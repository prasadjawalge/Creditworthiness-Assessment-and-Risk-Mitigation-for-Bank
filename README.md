## Creditworthiness-Assessment-and-Risk-Mitigation-for-Bank

### Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a comprehensive data-driven approach implemented to optimize loan approval decisions, minimize non-performing assets, and provide actionable insights for the Bank's Personal Loan underwriting process. The primary goal of this project is to ensure an accurate assessment of creditworthiness and the development of effective risk mitigation strategies.

### Project Description
- #### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

The first step of the project involved thorough exploration and analysis of the available data. This phase aimed to understand the characteristics of the dataset, identify any patterns, anomalies, or trends, and gain insights into the variables that are most relevant to loan approval decisions.
- #### Feature Engineering:

Feature engineering is a crucial step in improving the predictive power of our model. We developed new features and transformed existing ones to capture the nuances of the data better. This process helps in creating a more robust and accurate model.
- #### Logistic Regression Modeling:

We employed logistic regression modeling as the primary predictive tool for assessing creditworthiness. Logistic regression is well-suited for binary classification problems like loan approval. We fine-tuned the model to achieve the best possible performance.

- #### Risk Mitigation Strategies:

Based on the insights gained from the analysis and model, we identified and implemented risk mitigation strategies. These strategies aim to reduce the bank's exposure to non-performing assets by making informed and accurate loan approval decisions.
